CBAppVersion is a simple class that represents an immutable application version, with a 
major and minor version, and an optional subminor version. The subminor version is
assumed to be zero when not otherwise given, and is omitted from printing when zero
Version strings are in the form "x.y.z", where x, y, and z must all be unsigned integers 
(z is optional). Badly-formatted input will either except or parse as zeros, depending.
